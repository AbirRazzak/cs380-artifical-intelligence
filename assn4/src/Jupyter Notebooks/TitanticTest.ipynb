    "'Parch' represents the number of parents and children are on board. When looking at the Palsson's you can see that the 3 children (Gosta, Torborg, Stina) all have 3's for SibSp. This would indicate incorrect data, however they have a 1 for Parch, which means they have a parent (or nanny) on board. When looking at Passenger 567, she has a 4 in Parch, which indicates that there are 4 children on board, 1 of which is just omitted from the data set. This would explain why the children have a 3 for SibSp and why 567 has a 4 for Parch."
